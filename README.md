# Jungle-Havoc
Jungle Havoc is a game that I created for a game-jam competition. This game is made in GameMaker Engine which is a free software to create Windows games. 

# To run the game, download Jungle-Havoc.exe.
# To edit project files, download the folder named Jungle-Havoc.gmx

Used GameMaker's own language, GML to code.

# Have used Object Oriented Programming extensively in the making of this project.
